# Calculator-Application-Using-Method-Overloading
This is a Java console application that demonstrates method overloading. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program handles different data types and divide-by-zero exceptions.
## ✨ Features
- ➕ Add two integers, two doubles, or three integers (method overloading)  
- ➖ Subtract two integers  
- ✖️ Multiply two doubles  
- ➗ Divide two integers with divide-by-zero handling  
- 🖥️ Menu-driven interface for easy navigation  
- 🔒 Input validation to prevent crashes from invalid input
